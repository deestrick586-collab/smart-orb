## 🧩 Classroom Ideas  
- **Morning Check-In:** Students ask how the Orb “feels,” learning about emotional states and empathy.  
- **STEM Projects:** Explain how sensors, light, and code combine to create interactive behavior.  
- **Ethics Lab:** Read the `/ethics/` documents together and discuss fairness, honesty, and privacy.  
- **Creative Writing:** Invite students to write short stories from the Orb’s point of view.  

---

## 🌙 Healthy Use Guidelines  
- Limit sessions to short, focused periods (15–30 minutes).  
- Encourage group interaction—no child should use the Orb in isolation for long periods.  
- Respect the **Rest & Balance Protocol**: when the Orb dims its glow, it’s teaching self-care.
